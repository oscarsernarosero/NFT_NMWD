### You can inmortalize yourself by setting the msg on your NFt

War on Drugs has done nothing but to vulnerate our freedoms and to terrorize us the people with gang violence and irrational fears around drugs. We are part of a pioneering group of people that want a change: a world free of a militarized war on drugs that is a complete sham, and instead we want a real war on addictions, based on education, science and realistic regulations that doesn't take away our freedoms.

This NFT offers you the possibility to be part of history. Later in time, people will look at us as the brave women and men that stood up against a hypocrit war that has killed literally millions of people. You as a first buyer of this collection of NFTs, will be able to express yourself by setting a message about how you feel about war on drgugs right on your NFT. This message will live for ever in the Ethereum network. **This message can only be set once and can never be changed, so choose your message carefully**. This message can only be set only by the owner of the NFT and nobody esle whatsoever. You can add an alias at the end of the message to prove to your grand kinds --or whoever else-- that it was you who set the message. You can also choose not to set any message at all, and resell your NFT later at a greater price.
