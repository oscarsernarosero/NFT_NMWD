                                All of us were born in a prohibitionist world which makes it very hard for a lot of us to wrap our mind around the idea that the prohibition must end. A lot of us think that drugs are the devil, or that drugs should be banned because otherwise we would have an epidemic of drug abuse, or that we have seen so many cases of people getting destroyed by drugs that it is obvious that prohibition is the only solution. And this is totally understandable because we have been told these ideas over and over again throughout our whole lives, but what if I tell you that I can prove all of these assumptions are wrong?
                                <br/><br/>
First of all, the results of prohibition will do all the job for me at proving that prohibition is not the way to go. Just think about it. The US has banned the recreational use of drugs for more than 100 years now, and the US is still one of the leaders in the world in drug consumption. Just this argument alone should be enough to prove that such an arbitrary prohibition achieves nothing, and I will explain later why I use the adjective “arbitrary” in a second.
<br/><br/>
However, there are some people that think that the problem with prohibition is that it is not enforced enough, or that it is not strict enough to force people to actually stop using drugs. Nonetheless, history once again proves this wrong. Countries that have loosened the drug policies have actually seen a slight improvement in the drug-abuse cases such as the Netherlands and Portugal, which shows how laws around the use of some drugs don’t have much effect in the consumption of them. If anything, prohibition can just make it worse. 
<br/><br/>
Alcohol, for instance, was banned in the 1920s in the US, and ironically, it was the same decade where women started drinking alcohol regularly in bars (speakeasies during the dry times). Before the 1920s, it was not common to see women drinking alcohol, and it was even more uncommon to see them drinking in public. This all changed during prohibition times, ironically enough. 
<br/><br/>
The overall consumption of alcohol, which is also a drug by the way, during the short lived prohibition era was not affected by these prohibitionist laws as large amounts of data suggests. On the other hand, violence and mafia took over the country during this decade, and corruption and crime flourished as a natural consequence of pushing a millions-of-dollars industry into the black-market pockets, which leads us to the important part of this introductory article, and it is very important because it can save millions of lives around the world if we get the message. 
<br/><br/>
As we saw, prohibition doesn’t really reduce drug consumption. Actually, data suggest it can make it worse. So, it would be safe to say that prohibition fails in its primary goal which should be reason enough to try a different approach. However, for some people, it is still safer to keep drugs under strict prohibition so we don’t risk the lives of the younger generations. However, the problem with prohibition is its terrible side effects that actually endanger the lives of not only the younger generations, but the lives of all of us, specially in the poor communities of the world. 
<br/><br/>
The main reason to end the war on drugs is that it kills more people than drugs themselves. Don’t get me wrong. Drugs should be regulated under carefully designed strategies, but zero tolerance prohibition is not the solution. The whole problem with prohibition is that it literally puts hundreds of billions of dollars into criminal pockets. Since drugs can’t be commercialized in a legal way, the only people who can supply drugs are those who operate outside the law. In other words, mafias. 
<br/><br/>
Stories of great kingpins such as Pablo Escobar, or El Chapo, or even those gangs that terrorize the streets of the industrialized world wouldn’t be possible at all without prohibition. It was prohibition which channeled billions of dollars through those gangsters, not drugs themselves.
<br/><br/>
From this point on, a monstruos tree of negative consequences is born. The amount of money on criminal hands go to territory control through violence, defense against law enforcement, and government agents bribery. All of this generate an endless cycle of violences and corruption that little by little degenerates the society as a whole. 
<br/><br/>
Today, we can see how we glorify through TV series and mainstream music the lives of murderers and criminals for the amount of money and power they achieved through drug dealing. And, what is even worse, we all pay for this backwards war with our taxes. 
<br/><br/>
But this is just the beginning. The war on drugs was born for totally different reasons than the ones we have been told, but that is for another article. For now, just be aware. The war on drugs is nothing more the a war on you and your freedoms.

                                In this article we’re going to be
talking about meth, the drug from the famous series Breaking Bad, and we’ll talk about its
history throughout the 1930s. We will see how the story unfolds until WWII from the viewpoint of
the drug trade, and, once again, we’re going to demonstrate how the war on drugs has been
nothing but a sham. Stick around for more.<br/><br/>
Let’s start off by talking about the new drugs that surfaced in the thirties.
It isn’t clear where or when the first amphetamines were synthesized. Some say it was Germany
in 1889, and some say it was Romania in 1910. What’s known for sure is that they were given
no particular use at first. It wasn’t until 1930 when they were sold to the public for the first time in
the U.S. by pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline and French.
Just like in the case of morphine, heroine and cocaine in their beginnings, the sale of
amphetamines was completely legal and open, that is to say, no prescription was required to
find amphetamines in pharmacies during the 1930s. It was somewhat like finding headache
medication today, although this drug was not known as amphetamine at the time, but instead
was known by the name Benzedrine.<br/><br/>
American doctors prescribed Benzedrine to their patients to treat depression, fatigue,
narcolepsy, obesity and other illnesses, since among the effects of amphetamines are lucidity,
increased energy,, and insomnia.
This drug began to increase in popularity in American households since it increased the feeling
of wellbeing and productivity.
In fact, in the thirties and forties, something very peculiar happened; because amphetamines
were perfectly legal and their effects were very similar to those of cocaine, which was forbidden,
amphetamines began to replace the Andean drug in the streets of the world. That is, hardly
anyone still consumed cocaine; everyone consumed Benzedrine. Cocaine would make a
comeback to the world stage only in the seventies, when amphetamines were banned and when
disco culture assimilated the white powder into its fashion trends.<br/><br/>
Amphetamines thus began to be commercialized around the world for the first time. Sold freely
in pharmacies, initially in the U.S., they were prescribed by doctors to treat narcolepsy, fatigue,
and depression, and were used by the public at large.
This didn’t stop in the U.S., however. The Germans, already under Nazi ruled in the mid-thirties,
were fascinated by American amphetamines. For them, amphetamines were an incredible
product, and they decided not to lag behind, and began to commercialize a similar product of
Japanese origin called methamphetamine, which are very similar to amphetamines with the key
distinction of being more quickly assimilated by the brain.<br/><br/>
Methamphetamines are now known in the streets as Crystal Meth, but back then in German
pharmacies they were known as Pervitin.
Let’s look at meth in a more familiar context, after all it is the drug that was produced in the
popular series by the two main characters.
This could explain why the alias of Walter White was Heisenberg.<br/><br/>
But back to our topic, despite the Nazi party’s strict general anti-drug policy, methamphetamines
managed to become very famous within that organization because of the feeling of mental
sharpness and fortitude that the drug induced. That is, the Nazis gave methamphetamines an
extraordinary treatment because it helped them increased their productivity, unlike alcohol and
opium for example, which provided an escape from reality.
Besides, the increased strength and lucidity matched the Nazi ideal of the Übermensch
perfectly.<br/><br/>
It’s worth clarifying that when we say the Nazis were anti-drug, we’re talking about those drugs
listed in the treaty of The Hague of 1912, and not other legal drugs of widespread consumption
like caffeine or sugar.<br/><br/>
Throughout WWII, the use of methamphetamines was crucial in Hitler’s infamous Blitzkrieg, or
lightning-war, characterized by its speed and ferocity. With methamphetamines, Nazi soldiers
were seemingly immune to exhaustion, able to wage battle after battle for days on end, without
sleep, across unthinkable distances and fight with superhuman strength,
That’s right. A part of the astounding military might of the third reich was no more than these
synthetic drugs. And this fact would come back to them with a vengeance, and play a role in
their defeat, as methamphetamine abuse wrought havoc among German soldiers.<br/><br/>
The Germans were thus the first to use drugs as a weapon of war. But they weren’t the only
ones. WWII was fought to a large extent under the influence of drugs, since the majority of
armies involved would end up supplying amphetamines or methamphetamines to their soldiers.
For example, when the British realized that German pilots took methamphetamine, they began
to do the same to increase their pilots’ performance starting in 1942, since up to that moment,
the British were being harshly beat by the Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>
On the other hand, the Americans began to consume amphetamines since the start of the North

African operations by order of General Dwight Eisenhower, who would later become the thirty-
fourth president of the U.S.
<br/><br/>
The Japanese, furthermore consumed amphetamines in combat, but above all in large
quantities in preparation for kamikaze suicide attacks.
In fact, Japan suffered a severe crisis of amphetamine abuse after the end of WWII since
enormous quantities of the drug that went unused during the war were sold to the Japanese
public, legally and illegally.<br/><br/>
But speaking of WWII, and changing the subject a bit from amphetamines and
methamphetamines, let’s explore what was going on in the world of drug trafficking at the time,
where we can see, clear as day, the hypocrisy of the War on Drugs. So don’t miss the second
part of this article.

                                    In previous videos we saw how total prohibition in the 1920s had the opposite effect to what prohibitionists had promised. That is, alcohol consumption increased during the years of prohibition, the problem of drug addiction intensified, and organized crime and corruption got out of hand. 
                                    <br/><br/>
During this decade we also saw the birth, rise and flourishing of the mob, which had deep implications for American society and the world. Something that was already discernible during prohibition, however, was the start of prohibitionism as a source of illicit enrichment for institutions, and the use of the illegal drug trade as a strategy or tool for diversion. 
<br/><br/>
We saw this clearly in New York in the 20s, when police officers, who were in the pockets of the mob, began to blame illegal heroin in the streets for an increase in criminal activity. A perfect excuse for them, since the police was not in charge of contraband control or dealing with the illegal heroin trade. Besides, prohibition had managed to associate heroin with the poorer sectors of the population, and with delinquents, which made the drug an easy target and a very effective weapon of diversion. And so, corruption in the police force would become a minor issue in the eyes of the public. Just as it happens today in Latin American countries. 
<br/><br/>
This famous manipulation strategy, which involves creating a problem to then offer a solution and thus become essential, would be the beginning of something more important: the prohibition of drugs as a political tool. 
<br/><br/>
But we can’t tell this story without previously talking about a drug that has been conspicuously absent. We’re talking about none other than marijuana. So stick around and let’s explore this story. 
<br/><br/>
Marijuana, or cannabis, originated in Asia, but Europeans began growing in the Middle Ages, and it was used primarily for the naval industry, since it was the source of fiber with which sails and ropes for ships were made. 
<br/><br/>
With the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, cannabis also began to be grown all over the New World to continue the production of fibers for naval industry. 
<br/><br/>
But despite the fact that marijuana was grown all over the world, cannabis as a recreational drug wasn’t very popular before the 20th century, except in a few countries like India, Egypt and other parts of the Middle East and the Mediterranean. 
<br/><br/>
In these countries the use of cannabis, both medicinally and recreationally, had been in practice for millennia. In Egypt, for example, the use of marijuana likely goes as far back as several thousand years, as some hieroglyphic texts from the time of the Pharaohs seem to suggest. 
<br/><br/>
In fact, marijuana could be a considered a substitute for alcohol in this country during the Middle Ages since Egypt, being a Muslim country, banned alcohol consumption. So the recreational use of cannabis was widespread and popular in Egypt, to the point where Napoleon’s troops turned to weed when they occupied the country, because they found no beer or wine to relax. 
<br/><br/>
However, this wasn’t the case in most of the Western Christian world. As we’ve explored in other videos, the Christian world’s drug of choice has been alcohol historically. So despite the fact that in a big chunk of the Americas cannabis was grown for fiber production, smoking it for its psychotropic effects was not very popular, save for a few exceptional cases. 
<br/><br/>
One of those exceptions were indigenous Mexicans, who had incorporated marijuana into their traditional medicine and recreational practices some time after the arrival of the Spaniards. 
<br/><br/>
Now, many will wonder, where did marijuana get its bad reputation? Well, if you’ve been watching my videos, I think you can begin to imagine why things turned out the way they did. So let’s carry on. 
<br/><br/>
In the decade of 1910 Mexican immigrants arrive in large volumes to the U.S. for the first time. This was partly due to the fact that the Mexican Revolution was wreaking havoc throughout the country. With the arrival of the Mexicans, the use of recreational marijuana also increased, and right away xenophobia and racism did their part, and marijuana began to develop a bad reputation among the white majority in the U.S. who referred to Mexicans in some cases as an inferior race. Something similar happened with Chinese migrants and opium in the late 19th century. 
<br/><br/>
Marijuana would gradually be discovered by the African American community in the Southern states, given their proximity to Mexico, and making way for marijuana to be associated not just with Mexicans but with that country’s Black population as well. 
<br/><br/>
In fact, the rise of jazz is often associated with the discovery of marijuana by the African American community in the Southern port of New Orleans, in the tens and twenties. 
<br/><br/>
But back to Mexicans, their customs were tolerated given the economic benefit they represented at the time. We’re talking about the tens and twenties. But with the Great Depression, brought about by the stock market crash in 29, these workers began to be seen as an undesirable workforce given the economic crisis. The typical rhetoric of “immigrants will take our jobs” became widely heard. 
<br/><br/>
Let’s recall that in the mid-twenties, the negative impact of the prohibition of other narcotics on addicts, and the declarations of the police concerning narcotics-related crime had engendered mass hysteria around psychotropics. This hysteria now included marijuana, due to the economic crisis and Mexican migration. 
<br/><br/>
This created a wave of prohibitionism in the late 20s and early 30s, to the point where by 1931, more than 20 of the 48 eight states had already banned cannabis in some way or another. 
<br/><br/>
But such prohibitions were declared only at a state level. Federal prohibition would come only two years later. 
<br/><br/>
But in order to understand how we got to Federal prohibition, it’s necessary to understand an important figure in the world of the illegal drug trade, who, amid these events in the 20s and 30s, was rising to the national scene in the middle of prohibition, and we’re not talking about a mobster, but the antithesis of organized crime. We’re talking about the first director of the U.S. anti-narcotics division: Harry Anslinger. 
<br/><br/>
So who was this Anslinger?
<br/><br/>
Anslinger got his start uncovering insurance fraud schemes for a railway company in Pennsylvania, U.S.A, which gave him great notoriety for the first time. Anslinger would then enlist in the army during WWI, although he would only carry out office duties. After the war, Anslinger occupied various diplomatic postings in countries like Germany, Venezuela and the Bahamas, where he’d also work with numerous military and police organizations to combat drug and alcohol smuggling. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger was a very efficient worker: diligent, results-oriented, and immune to mob bribes. 
<br/><br/>
So far so good with Anslinger. But let’s keep diving into this figure’s career. 
<br/><br/>
Despite Anslinger’s exemplary work with the government, what would take him to the top at a young age would be his contacts, friends in high places, in both the private and public sectors. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger was appointed, at 38 years of age, the first director of the newly created Federal Bureau of Narcotics the U.S. in 1930. The person who put him in such an important position was his wife’s uncle, who was none other than the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, and who came from a very wealthy and powerful family in the U.S., Andrew Mellon. 
<br/><br/>
The Federal Bureau of Narcotics, FBN, was the precursor to today’s DEA. 
<br/><br/>
Initially in 1930, Anslinger and the Narcotics Bureau were in charge of chasing drug distributors and consumers. But marijuana was not restricted at a federal level at the time, and for this reason it wasn’t in Anslinger’s radar at the beginning of the decade. Besides, his own experience told him cannabis didn’t pose a threat at all. Anslinger considered it an inoffensive drug, somewhat like caffeine. We now know he wasn’t particularly wrong about this. 
<br/><br/>
Nevertheless Anslinger radically changed his position with respect to marijuana in his first years directing the FBN. Why?
<br/><br/>
Well it seems Anslinger had more than one motive to do this. 
<br/><br/>
It turns out Anslinger’s friends in high places did not give him the posting for free. For example, his wife’s uncle, who had appointed him FBN director, also had investments in a chemicals firm called DuPont Chemical Company. This corporation was dedicated to the production of synthetic fibers since the mid-twenties and would invent nylon a decade later. 
<br/><br/>

The problem was that cannabis, which was used to procure natural fibers, had become a less expensive solution than synthetic fiber in the thirties, due to new advancements in natural fiber production technology. 
<br/><br/>
For Mellon and DuPont, cannabis was beginning to fatally threaten their million dollar investments in synthetic fibers. For them it was clear that they had to kick cannabis off the market by any means necessary, and Anslinger would be in charge of realizing their ambitions. 
<br/><br/>
So even though Anslinger was seemingly incorruptible, and he refused the mafia’s bribes unlike many other law enforcement officials, he apparently did so because his main source of income were the legitimate companies of his contacts, who benefited from narcotics prohibition. 
<br/><br/>
But this wasn’t Anslinger’s sole motive in changing his neutral position on marijuana to quite a hostile one. Another reason Anslinger had was that he needed to make his brand new department an important government agency in order to increase his influence and wealth. Let’s recall that around this time the FBI was also created, with J. Edgar hoover at the helm, and both were in locked a sort of race to see who could manage the most successful anti-crime agency. 
<br/><br/>
Hoover’s strategy, let’s remember, was to create a panic about communism, and Anslinger’s strategy would then be to create a panic about drugs. The greater the public’s fear of drugs, the greater the FBN’s power, and the greater the resources at its disposal. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger had such good luck that marijuana had already started to set off alarms in some states, as we mentioned previously, which made cannabis an easy target. 
<br/><br/>
So Anslinger would use state terrorism in the face of drugs as an inexhaustible source of power.
<br/><br/>
It’s worth remarking that although these two motivations we’ve seen so far for Anslinger to change his position regarding Marijuana are supported by overwhelming circumstantial evidence, the truth is that there’s no conclusive direct evidence to confirm that these were in fact Anslinger’s reasons for beginning to stigmatize marijuana. Nevertheless, a motive that is backed by ample evidence, and which we’ll be talking about now, is the virulent racism with which Anslinger would carry out his war on drugs. 
<br/><br/>
Here’s where things start to get ugly. Anslinger was so open about his racism and xenophobia that there are countless racist remarks he made publicly. These phrases give us a glimpse at one who was more than an agent declaring the War on Drugs; Anslinger was really an agent caught in a race war. 
<br/><br/>
For example, during the 1930s, when African American cultured had already taken center stage in American music with the rhythm of jazz, Anslinger said: “reefer makes d*rkies think they’re as good as white men.” 
<br/><br/>
But he didn’t stop there, he carried on with his racism, saying: “There are 100,000 total Marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes…and any others.” 
<br/><br/>
According to Anslinger, marijuana lead people who ingested it to commit murder without cause, to rape women and lose their minds. In his own words he said: “marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.” Another famous quote of his along the same lines goes: 
“Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.” 
<br/><br/>
His clearly racist view of Mexicans is evident in phrases like the following:
“ I wish I could show you what a small marijuana cigarette can do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.” 
<br/><br/>
Or when he said: “the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.” 
<br/><br/>
But also his anti-Black racism, in phrases like this one:
<br/><br/>
“Marijuana influences Negroes to look at white people in the eye, step on white men’s shadows and look at a white woman twice.” 
<br/><br/>
In practice, Anslinger was the synthesis of racism and xenophobia in the prohibition of drugs we’ve discussed in previous videos. His War on Drugs was seemingly no more than a war against minorities and an insatiable hunger for power. Power which he’d only attain through racism and fear mongering about drugs. 
<br/><br/>
But Anslinger would not grow the influence of his agency by playing by the rules. In order to increase his power it was necessary to cause complete terror in the American mind, and to this end, Anslinger used an arsenal of fake stories that tied marijuana with violence and crime. 
<br/><br/>
He also would make presentations with doctors, who parroted the words he told them to, since in all cases doctors did not ratify his theories. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger published numerous made-up accounts of murders cause entirely by the effects of marijuana. According to him, as we’ve established previously, marijuana turned users into killers, and the people who consumed it the most were Black people and Mexicans. In fact he called it the youth killer weed. Here is an excerpt of those writings: 
<br/><br/>
“Not long ago the body of a girl was found in terrible condition on a sidewalk after it had fallen from a window on a building in Chicago. Everyone said it had been a suicide, but in fact it had been a murder. The killer was a narcotic known in this country as marijuana, and in history as hashish.”
<br/><br/>
Anslinger’s State Terrorism with respect to narcotics made him a very powerful person during the three decades he managed to remain the director of the FBN. He boasted his power not only within the US but around the world. In fact, many drug policies in place today we owe to this shady character. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger would make sure to terrorize the public with lies about narcotics until the 60s, when he finally retired. 
<br/><br/>
His lies inspired Christian groups, who, believing Anslinger’s fabrications, created popular short films, like the successful “Reefer Madness” of 1936. 
<br/><br/>
So this is the figure who would lead the War on Drugs before the formal declaration in Nixon’s time. His racism, his high-level contacts and his thirst for power led him to impose his conservative personality on society by any means available, even through deception, fake stories, and inducing complete collective terror with fictional threats in people’s minds.  
<br/><br/>
Another proof of the sham the War on Drugs was, has been and will continue to be. 
<br/><br/>
But, like many other things in History, Anslinger’s crusade against drugs was not an isolated case. In fact, this crusade had started before him in a different context, as we had explained in a previous video. So let’s do a quick recap of international restrictions on marijuana. 
<br/><br/>
During the Opium Convention in Geneva in 1925, the Egyptians sought international support to add marijuana to the list of substances on the Treaty of The Hague of 1912. Up to that time the list contained only opium, morphine, heroin and cocaine. 
<br/><br/>
Wait what? We said that Egypt initially used cannabis freely for millennia, so how is it that Egypt was giving speeches against marijuana? Well, it turns out that after Napoleon’s brief invasion, Egypt fell into a diplomatic crisis, which resulted in a change of government from the Mamelukes, who had ruled for centuries, to an Ottoman commander by the name of Muhammed Ali. 
<br/><br/>
Muhammed Ali set out to modernize Egypt, since this country was believed to be stuck in the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the defeat before the French. In fact Muhammed Ali would be regarded as the father of modern Egypt. 
<br/><br/>
This figure, a foreigner ruling Egypt, inspired by European models, believed that marijuana use was one of those many customs that kept Egypt in the past and didn’t let it progress. So from the early 1800s, Muhammed Ali forbade marijuana use. 
<br/><br/>
This of course didn’t spell the end of cannabis consumption, it simply meant that it would move to the clandestine world, although this measure would remain in place for the following decades. 
<br/><br/>
But Egypt was not going to be left alone. The British arrived to occupy the country militarily in 1882, attempting to protect their economic interests in the country, especially given the newly built Suez Canal. And the British ended up staying in Egypt for several long decades. 
<br/><br/>
So the Egyptians in 1925, who were still trying to shake off the British occupation, decided to use marijuana prohibition as a geopolitical tool to delegitimize the Anglo-Saxon occupation. 
<br/><br/>
The Egyptian strategy was to make Great Britain look bad internationally for having failed to act over several decades to stop marijuana smuggling in the country, and also for levying taxes on the sale of cannabis in India. The Egyptian narrative depicted marijuana as a perverse thing, practically the devil himself, off which the British weren’t only profiting, but the British administration was being totally lax on Egyptian soil, which went against that country’s internal law. 
<br/><br/>
And thus Egypt finally got what they wanted and marihuana was annexed to the Treaty of The Hague in 1925, with the intent of delegitimizing the British occupation, although it would only be enforced till 1937. Perhaps by Anslinger’s own influence?
<br/><br/>

Before we close, I’d like to cite Anslinger one last time, now in the midst of the Cold War, when he said the following: “Marijuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing.”
<br/><br/>
The reason I chose to highlight this Cold War Era quote is because it stands in direct contradiction to his earlier remarks which called marijuana the most violent drug in the history of mankind, capable of driving people to murder without cause. l
<br/><br/>
This shows how Aslinger changed his story depending on the political circumstances of the time. In the 1930s, the principal concern of the public was violence and crime in the streets. In the 50s and 60s, it was communism. 
<br/><br/>
And so we end this video about the 1930s and cannabis, where racism, mainly against Mexicans and African Americans, raised alarm about marijuana for the first time. Afterwards, the police’s declarations about crime and heroin in the 1920s would add to the narcotics panic, which now included Marijuana. 
Finally, Harry Anslinger, director of the FBN, forerunner to the DEA, would deliver the final strike, and would, through his agency, make up all kinds of absurd stories to outlaw marijuana. From an international perspective, though, Egypt would lead to move to global prohibition. 
<br/><br/>
In this decade, the 1930s, narcotics prohibition began to take on its current form, where the war against the illegal drug trade comes a source of wealth and power not only for drug dealers, but also for those who supposedly pursue them. That is, the War on Drugs begins to look like a business, where a strategy is marketed as a solution that is actually the problem. 
<br/><br/>
But it will also consolidate its form as a political tool, where state terrorism towards narcotics begins to put an immense power in the hands of a few and the rights of the people are constantly violated. 
<br/><br/>
Anslinger would then be the personification of all that is wrong with prohibition. That is, the racism and xenophobia that caused the prohibition of drugs in the first place, and the complete misinformation around narcotics with the intent of creating collective terror, because state terrorism and the alleged War on Drugs would be the sole source of his wealth and power. 
<br/><br/>
Throughout the history of the 19th century and up to the 1930s, we saw how the concept of drugs as immoral was conceived and sustained by racism and ethnocentrism. That is, drugs beside alcohol are bad solely because they are the drugs of other cultures. Cultures they saw as less advanced. 
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, we saw how the association of drugs with poverty and criminality are nothing more than a consequence of the same prohibition of drugs. In other words, it was prohibition that condemned addicts to indigence, something that didn’t happen before prohibition, as we learned in a previous video. 
<br/><br/>
We also saw how these concepts were fueled by state agencies who sought to increase their income by playing on both sides of the law, or in the case of Aslinger, by working in the benefit of powerful private corporations. 
<br/><br/>
This would be a valuable lesson for the global elites, and we will continue to see over the next videos how it world be the governments of the world that would continue to use narcotics prohibition as a political and geopolitical weapon, where only elites win and the people are sacrificed in the process.
