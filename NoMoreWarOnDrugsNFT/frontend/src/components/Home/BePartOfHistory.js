                    By getting one or more of the No-More-War-On-Drugs NFTs you are not only supporting my channel and the artists who create \
                    these peaces of art, but you are also immortalizing yourself in the Ethereum blockchain. These NFTs offer the possibility \
                    of writting a message directly on the blockchain without the possibility of being modified or deleted ever! That's right. \
                    You have the possibility of expressing yourself against the war on drugs with a message that will live for ever in the \
                    Ethereum blockchain. We, together, will dismantel this war on drugs, and you will be able to prove to your grand kids that you \
                    were among the pioneers of this movement. What are you waiting for?
