        These are very special tokens that represent your believes and your values. </span>,

            these art works, but you are also <b>immortalizing yourself in the Ethereum blockchain for ever!</b> These NFTs offer the opportunity
            of writting a message against the nefarious <b>War On Drugs</b> directly into the blockchain without the possibility of being modified or deleted <b>ever!!! </b> 
            In other words, your message will be immortal. We, together, will pioneer and make history in the blockchain political activism to end this horrendous War On Drugs that takes away our freedoms and rights,and you 
            will be able to prove to your kids and grandkids that you were among those pioneers that changed the world. What are you waiting for?</span>

        <b> War On Drugs</b> has done the most harm. In other words, artists from cities like Cali, Colombia or Culiacán, México.
        People who suffer -through their skin- the cartels brutality and government corruption in their daily lives --the natural 
        outcome of prohibition. We want to make the pain into art. </span>,

        This NFT project is one of the first ones to implement ERC2907 which aims to support royalties for
        NFT creators. SWD has a standard 8.00% royalty for all NFTs, and, as a rule of thumb, SWD grants a percentage of 
        the total amount of royalties collected to <b>all</b> the artists who collaborate in the art creation. This percentage 
        can be somewhere between 15% and 50% depending on the preference of payment of the artist. To know more about
        this, you can check out our artist partner program. </span>
